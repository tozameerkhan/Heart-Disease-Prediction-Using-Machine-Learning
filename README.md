# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Through this study we are analyzing the heart related diseases on the basis of various factors like age, blood pressure, gender etc. Furthermore, we are modeling the various classification models, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bias, SVM(Support Vector Machine) and Random Forests. Prediction of events of heart ailments in restorative field is critical work. Information investigation is valuable for prediction from more data and it encourages medicinal focus to foresee of different infection. Gigantic measure of patient related information is kept up on month to month premise. The put away information can be helpful for wellspring of foreseeing the event of future sickness. This report provides an insight of the existing algorithm and it gives an overall summary of the existing work regarding this particular topic.
